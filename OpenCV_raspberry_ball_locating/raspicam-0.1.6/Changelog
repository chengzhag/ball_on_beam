0.1.5
  - corrected the behaviour of CV_CAP_PROP_WHITE_BALANCE_RED_V and CV_CAP_PROP_WHITE_BALANCE_BLUE_U in raspicam_cv
0.1.4
  - Updates to latest version of the controllers. Bug corrected with BGR RGB swapping
  - Added set/getFrameRates in raspicam and raspicam_cv
  - Added rotation capabilities in raspicam_cv via  set(CV_CAP_PROP_ROLL,val)

0.1.3
  - Native support for BGR and RGB in opencv classes. No need to do conversion anymore.
0.1.2
  - Solved deadlock error in grab
0.1.1
  - Moved to c++11  mutex  and condition_variables. Bug fixed that caused random dead lock condition in grab()
0.1.0
  - Bug fixed in release for RapiCam and RaspiCam_Cv
0.0.7
  - Added classes  RaspiCam_Still and RaspiCam_Still_Cv for still camera mode
0.0.6
  - Bug ins cv camera corrected
0.0.5 
  - getImageBuffeSize change by getImageBufferSize (sorry)
  - Change in capture format. Now, it is able to capture in RGB at high speed. 
  - The second parameter of retrieve is now useless. Format must be specified in Raspicam::(set/get)Format before opening the camera and can not be change during operation.
  - RaspiCam_Cv captures in BGR, which is obtained by converting from RGB. Therefore,  performance drops to half repect to the RaspiCam in RGB mode when using 1280x960.
0.0.4
  - Added shutter speed camera control
  - OpenCv set/get params are now scaled to [0,100]
  - Added more command line options in test programs
0.0.3
  - Fixed error in color conversion (rgb and bgr were swapped)
  - Added command line options in raspicam_test to adjust exposure
  - Changes in RaspiCam_Cv so that exposure can be adjusted. Very simply.
0.0.2
 - Decoupled opening from the start of capture in RaspiCam if desired. RapiCam::open and RaspiCam::startCapture
 - Added  function RaspiCam::getId and RaspiCam_Cv::getId
 - Added a new way to convert yuv2rgb which is a bit faster.Thanks to Stefan Gufman (gruffypuffy at gmail dot com)
 - Added command line option -test_speed to utils programs (do not save images to memory)
 - Removed useless code in private_impl
0.0.1
Initial libary
